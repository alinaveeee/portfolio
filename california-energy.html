        <p>In this class project, I created a data visualization of California's energy resources. Selecting data and visual variables showed me how much choice there is in the stories we tell through data.</p>

            <h3>About This Project</h3>
                <p class="first-p">This was an individual project for my Infographic and Data Visualization Design class at CSUSB. To design my visualization, I sourced, cleaned, and analyzed data. This project lasted about three weeks.</p>
            <h3>The Assignment</h3>
                <p class="first-p">In this project, we were tasked with designing a network or hierarchical data visualization for a magazine spread.</p>
            <h3>My Deliverable</h3>
                <p class="first-p">I designed a data visualization of California's energy resources for National Geographic Magazine. <span class="highlight">My design tells a story about California's progress towards its 2045 goal of 100% renewable energy resources.</span></p>
                <img src="assets/ca-energy.jpg">
                <p>Using area, hue, value, and position, my visualization communicates the amount of energy produced by each county, how much of that energy is renewable, and the population of each county.</p>
            
            <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
            <h3>Energy and Income in California</h3>
            <p class="first-p">When I started this project, I wanted to visualize relationships between energy and income in California. I was interested in trends dealing with energy produced, energy consumed, and the frequency of power outages.</p>
            <img src="assets/ca-energy-proposal.jpg">
            <p class="caption">Sketch of my initial idea.</p>
            <p>These were some of the questions I was hoping to answer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where does power come from in California?</li>
                <li>How much is generated and where?</li>
                <li>How much is used and where? For what purpose?</li>
                <li>How often is power shut off and where?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="research">Research</h2>
            <h3 id="gathering-data">Gathering Data</h3>
                <p class="first-p">I started by gathering data dealing with energy in California, and consulted the census for data on income by county and city.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">My biggest challenge was finding data at the same hierarchical level and time.</span> Because 2020 was a census year, I had data for income and population at all hierarchical levels. I only needed to match my energy data to this year, but all of my sources varied. In the end, I was only able to find live data on outages, so I decided to explore other directions.</p>
            <h3 id="understanding-data">Understanding the Data</h3>
                <p class="first-p"><span class="highlight">I combined all of my data for 2020 at the county level into one spreadsheet, and created pivot tables and graphs</span> to see if there were any trends in the data.</p>
                <p>Based on the data, I decided to visualize energy resources for California. These were the new questions I wanted to answer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where does power come from in California?</li>
                    <li>How much energy is generated?</li>
                    <li>Where is energy generated?</li>
                    <li>What kind of energy is generated?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>California has set a goal of being powered by 100% renewable energy by 2045, so I decided to make my visualization a story about progress and work to be done.</p>

                <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="design">Design</h2>
                <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
                    <p class="first-p">I sketched out different ideas, exploring different chart types and visual variables.</p>
                    <img src="assets/ca-energy-ideation.png" class="no-caption">
                <h3 id="iterations">Iterations</h3>
                    <p class="first-p">The amount and type of energy were the most important variables for my story, so I chose to represent them through size and color. Size was a straightforward calculation based on the amount of energy produced, but <span class="highlight">choosing a meaningful and accessible color palette required more time and consideration.</span></p>
                    <p>I researched a few accessible color palettes and worked up digital roughs for feedback in class.</p>
                    <img src="assets/ca-energy-draft-1.png" class="no-caption">
                    <p>Based on the feedback I received, I chose to move forward with the divergent red and blue color palette. <span class="highlight">The hue alone communicates whether a county is producing more renewable or non-renewable energy. Readers can focus on the specific value for more granular information.</span></p>
                    <img src="assets/ca-energy-draft-2.png" class="no-caption">
                    <p>I continued experimenting with different layouts, trying to account for the gutter of the magazine while adding the necessary keys and a secondary, contextual line graph. But, after adding connections, I still needed to revise my layout.</p>
                <h3 id="final-design">Final Design</h3>
                    <img src="assets/ca-energy-final-design.jpg" class="no-caption">
                    <p class="first-p">The area of each circle represents the total energy produced in gigawatt hours (GWh). A red hue means most of that energy was non-renewable, while blue means a majority renewable. The circles representing the counties are arranged by population, with the more populous counties at the top.</p>

            <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p class="first-p">In this project, I learned that there is always a story to be told through data. Even though I didn't have the right data for my initial idea, I was able to tell a different story about energy in California. In that sense, data visualizations are never purely objective&mdash; we can always choose which data and variables to include in order to create a certain narrative.</p>
