        <p>I designed Comette, a retrofuturistic typeface inspired by Futura and the Moon landing. Through my research, I learned how history defines typographical meaning and carries into our visual language today.</p>

            <h3>About This Project</h3>
                <p class="first-p">This was an individual project for my Typography and Layout class at CSUSB. Over the course of four weeks, I created a concept, designed a typeface based on research, and made a digital font.</p>
            <h3>The Assignment</h3>
                <p class="first-p">In this project, we were tasked with designing an expressive typeface for a fictional artist.</p>
            <h3>My Deliverable</h3>
                <p class="first-p">I created Comette, a geometric sans-serif typeface for display. <span class="highlight">Inspired by the Motown era, Paul Renner's Futura, and the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Comette embodies a retrofuturistic look.</span></p>

            <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="ideation">Ideation</h2>
            <h3 id="imagining-artist">Imagining the Artist</h3>
                <p class="first-p">I started this project by imagining my artist. <span class="highlight">I wanted the retro feel of a Motown group with an afrofuturistic direction like Janelle Mon√°e.</span> I created a mood board to gather all of my inspiration in one place.</p>
                <img src="assets/comette-moodboard.jpg" alt="A Pinterest moodboard with images of Afrofuturistic art, Motown ephemera, Janelle Monae album covers, and geometric typefaces. The overall color palette yellow, orange, pink, and purple.">
                <p class="caption">My mood board for The Comettes.</p>
                <p>I created The Comettes, named for the celestial body in the fashion of Motown groups like The Ronettes and The Supremes.</p>

            <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="research">Research</h2>
            <h3 id="serif-sans-serif">Retrofuturism Through Type</h3>
                <p class="first-p">My retrofuturistic vision for The Comettes required a balance of old and new in my typeface design.</p>
                <p>After researching the history of sans-serif typefaces, <span class="highlight">Futura became a major inspiration for my typeface.</span> Designed by Paul Renner in 1927, today it can be considered a past vision of a modern future.</p>
                <p>Futura has also come to be associated with space and the future. In 1968, it was featured prominently in the film <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>&mdash; another past imagining of the future, by today's standards. And, a year later, Futura really made it to outer space. <span class="highlight">When Apollo 11 landed the first humans on the Moon, a commemorative plaque&mdash; set in Futura&mdash; was left behind.</span></p>
                <imG src="assets/comette-apollo-11-plaque.jpg" alt="Stainless steel plaque that reads: Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.">
                <p class="caption">The Apollo 11 plaque. Photo: NASA.</p>
                <p>I discovered that Futura was actually a favorite of NASA for a time. From about 1961-1976, Futura was used on all of their materials [<a href="#reference-1">1</a>]. NASA will always have a futuristic feel, but the era defined by Futura is situated firmly in the past.</p>

                <p class="first-p">Inspired by Futura and its place on the Moon, <span class="highlight">I decided to design a geometric sans-serif typeface.</span></p>
                <img src="assets/comette-sketch.jpg" class="no-caption">
                <p>I started by sketching geometric letterforms.</p>
                <img src="assets/comette-sketch-2.jpg" class="no-caption">
                <p>After some feedback, I opted for a low x-height and I worked on adapting my letteforms to create additional letters.</p>
            <h3 id="increasing-fidelity">Increasing Fidelity</h3>
                <p class="first-p">Next, I created vectors for each letter in Illustrator. I built each letter on a grid, using straight lines and circle segments for curves.</p>

            <h3 id="creating-font">Creating a Font</h3>
                <p class="first-p">I imported my vectors into BirdFont to create a working font file. Then, I used Comette to create mockups of concert tour ephemera for The Comettes.</p>

            <h2 class="small-caps new-section" id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p class="first-p">The best part of this project was researching typographical history. Learning about Futura and NASA and the Moon was really interesting. It's amazing how much history a typeface can have and how that history informs our visual language and interpretation today&mdash; whether we are aware of it or not.</p>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                <p class="first-p">If I were to revisit this project, I would start by revising a few of my symbols. Looking back, I can see that my apostrophes and quotations aren't distinguishable from hatch marks. Updating these symbols would also influence the design of my comma and semicolon. From there, I would want to expand this typeface to include lowercase letters and additional symbols.</p>
