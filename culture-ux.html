            <h3>About this project</h3>
                <p class="first-p">I completed this research as my senior thesis for the University Honors Program at CSUSB under the supervision of Associate Professor Rob Ray. Over the course of this project, I developed a research topic, conducted a literature review, designed the study, recruited and screened participants, carried out testing sessions, and analyzed data. I also presented my research at CSUSB's 12th annual Meeting of the Minds.</p>
                <p>This research was approved by the CSUSB Institutional Review Board.</p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p class="first-p">UX is a traditionally Western field. As it has grown and become practiced internationally, many researchers have questioned whether UX research methods are as effective in non-Western cultures. Existing research suggests that culture does have an impact on UX research methods. However, many of these studies compare methods across broad, international groups. As a result, their findings are limited to the dominant cultural groups of each country. Additionally, while there are studies that compare UX research methods across cultural groups within an individual country, these studies do not occur in the West. In general, <span class="highlight">there is a Western vs non-Western framing and an assumption that traditional UX research methods are effective across all of the West.</p></span>
                <p>I tested three UX research methods with Black, Asian, and Latinx women. In a mock usability study, I asked participants to think aloud, complete a survey, and then interviewed them. Then, in a follow-up interview, we discussed their experiences with each of the three methods. Based on these discussions, the <span class="highlight">Black, Asian, and Latinx women in this study seem to have experienced UX research methods differently.</span> Black and Latinx women experienced tensions during the think aloud, while Asian women did not.</p>

            <h2 class="small-caps">Literature Review</h2>
            <h3>What do we know about culture and UX research methods?</h3>
                <p class="first-p">In my research, I found <span class="highlight">two types of studies</span> that investigate the role of culture in UX research. The first type of study is what I call the “international study.” <span class="highlight">International studies test and compare UX research methods across multiple countries.</span> One example of this is a 2002 study by Evers. In this study, Evers tested the think aloud, survey, and interview with English, North American, Dutch, and Japanese participants.</p>
                <p>The second type of study is what I call the “national study.” National studies also test UX research methods across cultural groups. However, these studies have a narrower scope&mdash; they <span class="highlight">compare cultural groups within one country.</span> For example, a 2011 study by Hsieh tested the survey and interview with younger and older Taiwanese participants. There have been similar studies in Malaysia, India, and Namibia.</p>
                <p>Both national and international studies have found that <span class="highlight">culture does have an impact</span> on the efficacy of UX research methods. Evers found that surveys posed problems for English, Dutch, and Japanese participants. Hsieh found that younger Taiwanese participants were more likely to give feedback and criticism than older Taiwanese participants.</p>
            <h3>What don't we know?</h3>
                <p class="first-p">There are some issues to consider with the research so far.</p>
                <p>First, <span class="highlight">international studies lack specificity.</span> Because they compare such broad groups, it's important to question who exactly is being represented. Who were the “North American” participants in Evers' study? What does all of North America have in common that the entire continent was being compared to individual countries? As a Black and Mexican-American person, these were my first questions. Later, I found that Evers was referring to US Americans. Although I was initially mistaken, there was still a question of representation. And, while I first asked this question of Evers' study, it's a valid question for any of the international studies. <span class="highlight">How well were marginalized communities represented in these country-level groups?</span></p>
                <p>National studies don't necessarily have this problem because of their narrow scope. However, it's worth noting that none of these studies occur in a Western country. That means there is a level of specificity that we aren't engaging with in the West. In the case of the US, we have the findings from Evers' international study. But, <span class="highlight">should we accept these findings about US Americans when we haven't specifically centered on the experiences of marginalized communities?</span> These questions highlight the need for a national study in the US.</p>

                <p>In this study, we tested UX research methods with Black, Asian, and Latinx women. All of our participants were students at California State University, San Bernardino. Their ages ranged from <span class="highlight">18 to 24 years old.</span> It's important to note that <span class="highlight">none of them were Art or Design majors.</span> This was to ensure that they weren't overly familiar with web design concepts or the critiquing process.</p>
            <h3>We did this by...</h3>
            <h4>Mock Usability Study</h4>
                <p class="first-p">First, we conducted a mock usability study for a mobile website. In the usability study, I asked participants to complete think aloud tasks, fill out a survey, and then interviewed them. At the end of the usability study, I asked them to briefly <span class="highlight">rank each of the methods from most to least favorite.</span> Ranking the methods wasn't a metric&mdash; it was a strategy to open up discussion in the follow-up session. It was also a way to avoid framing any of the methods as problematic.</p>
            <h4>Follow-Up Interview</h4>
                <p class="first-p">In the follow-up, I asked participants to explain their rankings. We <span class="highlight">discussed their attitudes toward each of the methods</span> in detail. Then, we talked about any behaviors I observed during the study. After discussing the methods, we <span class="highlight">talked about the role of culture</span> in the study.</p>

                <p>After experiencing the three methods, everyone in our study said they believed culture could have an impact. They described ways they could imagine a person's culture influencing their behavior and comfort during the study. For example, multiple participants mentioned politeness in East Asian culture and suggested that East Asians with strong cultural ties might not feel as comfortable giving criticism in a usability study.</p>

            <h2 class="small-caps">Conclusion</h2>
            <h3>Are there cultural differences within the US?</h3>
                <p class="first-p">In some cases, there may be. However, this study can't answer that question as it applies to the entire US. Based on the data, <span class="highlight">we can only say that the Black, Asian, and Latinx women in this study had these particular experiences.</span> And, we must acknowledge that, although we've viewed these experiences through the lens of culture, <span class="highlight">we can't say that culture was the cause.</p></span>
            <h3>Limitations and Further Research</h3>
                <p class="first-p">This study was limited in multiple ways. First, the sample size of Black women was incomplete, while the overall sample size of the study is not significant. Additionally, my own identity may have influenced participants and their level of comfort with me, especially on the topic of culture.</p>
                <p>If these findings were to be validated in future research that addresses these limitations, then we might ask: Do these tensions impact the participation of Black and Latinx women in the UX research process? And, how might we ease these tensions and increase the comfort of Black and Latinx women?</p>
